	<h1>Formulas and Assumptions</h1>
	
	<p>This page explains the formulas and assumptions(F&As) that the simulator currently uses.</p>
	
	<p>The F&As used are gathered from the web and then finalized as what we think are reasonable. If you disagree with anything, you are more than welcome to let us know. Ultimately, the goal is for the simulator to be as accurate as possible.</p>
